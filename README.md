# GOTM_ISIMIP3_validation

For GOTM simulations for ISIMIP3 global lake simulation (more details [here](https://github.com/icra/ISIMIP_Lake_Sector) ), 7 water quality/physical variables were produced: watertemp (water temperature profile for 10 levels), surftemp (surface temperature), bottemp (bottom temperature), icetemp (ice temperature), icethick (ice thickness), latentheatf (latent heat flux), sensheatf (sensible heat flux). In order to validate the data obtained in the simulation some figures were created using ISIMIP3a data: (i) a mean map for each variable for each decade chunk, (ii) a map of a random day for each variable for each decade chunk, and (iii) a profile for one random year of a random pixel
